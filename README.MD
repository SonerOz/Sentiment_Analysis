## Sentiment Analysis

In this project, we preprocess the data, apply NLP techniques (such as get rid of stopwords, numbers, and lemmatize the words) to make cleaner data.Then apply Count Vectors and TFIDF Techniques(Word level, N-GRAM level, Character level). Then apply different ML algorithms such as LogisticRegressin, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost.
